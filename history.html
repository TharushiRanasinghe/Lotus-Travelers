            A kingdom is protected by an impenetrable rock, its monarchy is endowed with authority by a sacred tooth,
            and its people's sense of independence is bolstered by a prophecy. The city's rich past, influenced by political unrest,
            bravery, and intense spirituality, is colored by its tenacious resistance to foreign invasions.

            Kandy has the distinction of being the last Sri Lankan kingdom to finally fall to the British in 1815, having bravely
            resisted advances by Portuguese and Dutch forces in the 16th and 17th centuries. The Kandy Kingdom was filled with political 
            unrest and internal conflicts, which eventually made it accessible to the British, even though it managed to hold its ground 
            against European colonists for a significant amount of time.

        <h2>The Independent Kingdom</h2>
        <img class="img-flag" src="image/kandy_flag.png" alt="kandy-flag">

        <div class="p-2">
        <p>
            In the beginning, Kandy was a client state of the Kingdom of Kotte, which presided over central Sri Lanka throughout
            the 15th and 16th centuries. Following the dramatic Vijayab Kollaya events of 1521, in which King Vijayabahu VI of Kotte 
            was assassinated by his three sons Bhuvanekabahu, Pararajasingha, and Mayadunne, and the kingdom was split into three, 
            Kandy declared its independence from Kotte. The youngest brother Mayadunne, governed from Sithawaka, and was a threat to 
            all other states due to his powerful and active leadership. Kandy had to defend itself from Mayadunne, and it even thought
            of joining forces with the Portuguese to do so. When the Portuguese attempted to invade the country in 1546, the Kandyans
            were forced to soon fight them. The newly crowned King Rajasinghe I of Sithawaka successfully attacked the region in 1581,
            leading Kandy's King Jayaweera III and his daughter Kusumasana Devi to flee to the Kingdom of Jaffna.</p>

        <p> The Kandyan people were difficult for King Rajasinghe to rule over. Rajasinghe faced greater opposition after converting 
            to Hinduism and increasing taxes to pay for his repeated wars against the Portuguese. The son of Weerasundara Bandara, 
            who was assassinated by Rajasinghe based on treason, Konnappu Bandara, rose up against the monarch and assumed the 
            name Wimaladharmasuriya I to ascend to the throne of Kandy. Kusumasana Devi, by the time of their marriage, had converted 
            to Christianity and taken the name Dona Catherina. When he displayed the sacred tooth relic, a representation of Sinhala 
            Buddhist kingship that had previously been kept secret from the Portuguese, he solidified his position as the ruler of 
            the Kandyan Kingdom even further.</p>

        <p> Due to the steep terrain, which was nearly impassable during the rainy seasons, the Portuguese tried to take Kandy 
            repeatedly, but they were unsuccessful. Guerrilla warfare was effectively used by the Kandyans to stave off invaders 
            and defend the kingdom. 
        </p>
        </div><br>
        
        <h2>Portuguese & Dutch Influence</h2>
            
        <div class="p-2">
        <p>Senarat succeeded King Wimaladharmasuriya and signed a treaty with the Portuguese in 1617, recognizing Kandy as an 
            independent kingdom. His son Rajasinghe II was determined to expel Portuguese influence from the island but needed 
            the assistance of the Dutch to drive them out. This assistance came at a great cost, as the king had to pay the Dutch 
            for costs incurred in driving out the Portuguese and giving the Dutch East India Company (VOC) a monopoly of the spice 
            trade. His son ascended the Kandyan throne in 1707 as Veera Parakrama Narendrasinghe appointed his Indian Nayakkar 
            Queen's younger brother as his heir. The Dutch anticipated instability in the Kandyan Kingdom upon the passing away 
            of the biologically heirless king, but the transition to the non-Sinhalese Nayakkar dynasty was peaceful and failed 
            to give the Dutch their much-anticipated foot in.
        </p>
        <p>Hostilities between the Nayakkar kings and the Dutch continued, with the latter launching more invasions on the 
            kingdom and the monarchs having to quell some internal rebellions. The Kandyans were forced to sign a treaty 
            in 1766, due to famine conditions, and were completely landlocked and had no control over foreign trade, further 
            weakening the kingdom.
        </p>
        </div><br>
           
        <h2>British Influence</h2>
        <div class="p-2">
        <p>
            The British East India Company (EIC) began its occupation of Ceylon in 1796, settling in the coastal areas of the 
            island with little resistance. The Treaty of Amiens, signed in 1802, formally ceded complete control of Dutch occupied 
            Ceylon to Great Britain. In 1803, the British made an unsuccessful attempt at invading the Kingdom of Kandy in what was 
            to become known as the First Kandyan War. The tensions between the ruling Nayak king Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe and the 
            Kandyan nobility grew stronger, with the latter considering British rule preferable to the volatile Nayak king. 
            Ehelepola Nilame, a Sinhala noble, was appointed Maha Adikaram in 1811 but soon fell out of favor with the king.</p>

        <p> He defected to the British forces in a bid to avoid the wrath of the king, but the king brutally executed his family, 
            beheading his two sons, pounding his infant son to death, and drowning his wife and daughters in the newly built Kandy Lake. 
            Following these brutal executions, the king lost all support of the people of Kandy, and riots soon began, prompting him to 
            flee to Hanguranketha. 
        </p>
        </div><br>

        <h2>British Invasion of Kandy</h2>
        <div class="p-2">
        <p> A grieved Ehelepola supported the British invasion of Kandy in 1815, also known as the Second Kandyan War, after learning 
            of the awful destiny that befell his family. Without encountering any resistance, the British forces invaded the city, 
            and as a result, the British and the chiefs of the Kandy Kingdom signed the Kandyan Convention. Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe 
            was removed as a result of the convention, giving the British control over the realm. Over 2,000 years of self-rule on 
            the island of Sri Lanka came to an end at this point.
        </p>
        </div><br>

        <h2>Kandyan Uprising</h2>
        <img class="img-britishWar" src="image/The-brave.jpg" alt="british-war">
        <div class="p-2">
        <p> The Third Kandyan War began in 1817 when the Kandyans rose against the British. The Uva-Wellassa revolt was led by 
            Keppetipola Disawe, a Sinhala nobleman serving the Crown who joined the insurgents. Despite being apprehended and 
            executed, he rose to national fame and is still revered for his resistance to a foreign power. The Colombo Kandy 
            the route was constructed by the British to lower the morale of the Kandyans, and the Kadugannawa Pass is 
            seen to be a fulfillment of an old prophecy that would have given the British total control over the kingdom.
